        <p class="lead mb-4"> <br> I am currently working as a reading tutor at Highgrove Elementary School, with the afterschool program, HEARTS (Helping Elementary Achievers Reach the Stars). I started working there during my first year of college and have been working there ever since. As a reading tutor, I assist students with their homework assignments and independent reading. But I also communicate with each of the students to make sure they are feeling good and doing good. Being a tutor isnâ€™t about just helping the students, in my opinion, but its also about being someone who is there for them and that they can reach out to when they need personal help. </br>
        <br> As of now, I am a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Creative Writing but hope to switch to English soon. I plan on receiving my Masterâ€™s Degree in English by June of 2022, in order to further my career. With my English degree, I hope to become an editor and/or writer for a newspaper or magazine. My hopes as an editor or writer are to educate communities on social, environmental, and political issues and advise them to get involved with the solutions to these issues in their communities. I also plan on using my English degree to get involved in education. I can envision myself being an English teacher for elementary school students, and educating them on topics like grammar, punctuation, sentence structures, etc. If I do reach this career goal, I hope to move up within the education system and possibly move toward a higher position.</br> 
        <br> In my junior year of high school, I was given my first job opportunity to become a translator for the Los Angeles Maritime Institute. This position allowed me to work three to four hours every two weeks on a tall ship in San Pedro. I worked with other high school students from my high school to educate the passengers on Marine Biology. Some of the passengers were from Spanish speaking communities, so during presentations, we would have to translate our information from English to Spanish to accommodate those who didnâ€™t learn English as their first language. Our presentations required us to collect organisms from nearby bodies of water to bring them into our groups and educate the passengers on each marine organism. During our presentations, we would also educate them on the negative impact that humans have on our environment, that overall affect the health and lives of marine organisms. Having the passengers see the organisms for themselves worked as a motive for them to take part in solutions like avoiding the use of plastics and recycling the plastics that they do use.</br>
